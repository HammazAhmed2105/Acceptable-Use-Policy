# Creating an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

## Objective  
Understand the importance of an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and its role in managing user behavior and ensuring compliance within an organization.

## Steps  

### 1. Understanding AUP  
- **What is an AUP?**  
  An Acceptable Use Policy defines what is and isn’t acceptable in terms of technology use, including company-owned devices, networks, and internet usage.  
- **Examples of acceptable vs. unacceptable behaviors:**  
  - Acceptable: Using company email for work-related communication, following security policies.  
  - Unacceptable: Accessing inappropriate websites, installing unauthorized software.  

### 2. Drafting an AUP  
- **Research the structure and common components** of an AUP:  
  - Purpose  
  - Scope  
  - Prohibited activities  
  - Consequences of violations  
- **Draft an Acceptable Use Policy** that can be implemented in a fictional company. The policy should specify acceptable use of:  
  - Company devices  
  - Internet access  
  - Email  
  - Social media  

### 3. Review & Refinement  
- Gather feedback on the AUP draft to ensure clarity and completeness.  
- Consider real-world scenarios like:  
  - **BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)** policies  
  - **Remote work** considerations  

## Deliverables  
- 📄 A written **Acceptable Use Policy** document.  
- 🔍 A **short explanation** of the key points of the policy and their importance for cybersecurity.
